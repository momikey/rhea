# Introduction

Rhea is intended to be a mid-level generic programming language with a robust set of features allowing for safe, secure code.

At the moment, it is very much a work in progress, and that progress is at an early stage. Currently, parsing is completed, while syntax analysis is partially finished, and other parts are still on the drawing board. I hope to remedy this in the near future, but other projects are taking priority. If anyone would like to help, I'd be happy to let you.

# Documentation

Some documentation, including a syntax description and a few (theoretical) examples are contained in the `doc/` directory.
